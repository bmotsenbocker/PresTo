Optical_Ray_Tracing_Calculation.py can be used to calculate properties of a lens assembly in any medium. The medium used in this case is water, but you can change the refractive index for any liquid. The liquid cavities between glass lenses are treated as their own lens in this calculation. 

For Use:
Only edit the lens properties and lists of lens properties (n_list, r_front_list, etc.). You can add or subtract any number of lenses and liquid cavities, just input the properties and ajust the order in the lists. To calculate the FOV and aperture, edit the hard coded values in lines 123 and 130 to match your sensor and lens diameter.
